My Harry Potter Top Trumps Game

My program is based on the game 'Top Trumps'. For those not familiar with the game, each card in the deck has a character, and all of the characters have a range of characteristics or catagories. For example, these catagories could be height or age. The cards are dealt evenly between players, and players cannot look beyond their top card. Without seeing the other player's cards, one player chooses a catagory in the hope that they score the best within that catagory. 

The data for the 'cards' comes from a Harry Potter API.
There's....

The game starts by explaining the rules, then asking the user if they're ready to play, followed by how many rounds they'd like to play.

Features I would like to introduce
- cards are dealt at the start and don't come up again
- if a round is drawn, the two players look at their next card and the one who does better on the second card wins
- the winning player of each round gets to pick the next catagory
- when a player wins a round the cards are added to their deck
- high scores
